# Merlot-Authentication

# Hosting the application on Heroku

Install the following onto your local PC if not installed yet:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

**Note** - all code needs to be in the master branch and all code needs to be functional!

## Deploy the application

* Clone the the git by using command - (git clone https://github.com/Tilanie/Merlot-Authentication.git) -
* Once you have the code on your local machine, go to the directory of the rpository.

After that is done make sure of the following:

Run command and make sure the output is the same.
```
$ git remote -v
```
```
merlot-auth     https://git.heroku.com/merlot-auth.git (fetch)
merlot-auth     https://git.heroku.com/merlot-auth.git (push)
origin  https://github.com/Tilanie/Merlot-Authentication.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Tilanie/Merlot-Authentication.git (push)
```
 If the remote (merlot-auth) does not exist run the following command.
```term
$ heroku git:remote -a merlot-auth
// set git remote heroku to https://git.heroku.com/merlot-auth.git
```
Now you can deploy the code with the following command.
Use this command when you want to deploy the latest version of the code.
```
$ git push merlot-auth master
```
The application is now deployed and you can now run the application.

## Running the application

Once the application has been succesfully deployed you can now run the application.

Ensure that at least one instance of the application is running.
```
$ heroku ps:scale web=1
```
Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name.
```
$ heroku open
```
**Note** - this should throw an error since no body was sent with the request.

## Accessing the application

Once the application is running you can access the application and send requests to it by using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
Make sure postman is installed and set the folling fields:
* Method -> GET / POST

* Body -> {"type":["PIN","PIC"],"data":[123,456]}

**Note** - the body is test data and can be changed
**Note** - the body should be added as "raw", and JSON(application/json)

Once you are ready press send and wait for response.
