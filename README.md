# Merlot-Authentication

# Hosting the application on Heroku

All code needs to be in the master branch and all code need to be functional!

Once all code is in master you can push the Git files onto the remote Git (Heroku) by following these steps:
* Make sure you have the latest file locally and the origrin is => "https://github.com/Tilanie/Merlot-Authentication.git"
* Once you have all code locally, you can use this command - (git push merlot-auth master) - to push the origin to the remote
**Note** "merlot-auth" is the name of the remote Git
